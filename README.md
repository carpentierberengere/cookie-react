# Advanced Front-End Project - ReactJS Cookie Clicker

:cookie: Exploration project made by [**Bérengère Carpentier**](https://github.com/carpentierberengere), trainee @ BeCode.  
:cookie: Started on the 23rd of February, deadline on the 26th of February 5pm. 

## What is it about ? 

> *Cookie Clicker is an incremental game created by French programmer Julien "Orteil" Thiennot in 2013. The user initially clicks on a big cookie on the screen, earning a single cookie per click. They can then spend their earned cookies upon purchasing assets such as "cursors" and other "buildings" that automatically produce cookies. Upgrades are also available and can improve the efficiency of clicks and buildings, among many other mechanics that allow the user to earn cookies in different ways*. 

For this project, we had to use ReactJS to re-create our own cookie clicker app. 

# Learning Objectives & Instructions
